This is the launch of my new blog. I intend to post here when I want to share cool ideas, thoughts and experiences.

For all the techies out there - the blog stack is using `Next.js` and `tailwindcss` hosted on Github Pages currently since it's a static site.

I had a blog using Wordpress years ago, which was fine but now it's easier for me to write it myself :)

export default ({ children }) => (
  <BlogPostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPostLayout>
